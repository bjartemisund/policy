# Terms of Service for Whereby Embedded

Last updated: November 6, 2020

## 1. Agreement

These Terms of Service for Whereby Embedded (“Terms”) apply to the
use of the service Whereby Embedded (the "Service" or “Whereby”), and
constitute a contract between an individual or a company which shall
receive and use the Service (the “Customer”) and the Supplier providing
the Service, Video Communication Services AS, Gate 1 no. 101, 6700
Måløy, Norway (the “Supplier"). 

These terms govern the Customer’s access to and use of the Whereby
application and website (the “Service”), and any video, sound, text,
graphics, or other materials sent, received, stored or otherwise
appearing in the Service (collectively referred to as “Content”). Parts
of the Service may display Content that is not the Supplier’s (“User
Content”). Such content is the sole responsibility of the person or
entity that has made it available, see below for restrictions on content
in the Service. When “Content” is used in this document, it refers to
both contents provided by the Supplier and User Content collectively,
unless otherwise specified.

Where applicable, the “Supplier” shall also be understood as a reference
to sub-contractors the Supplier may engage or otherwise cooperate with
in connection with the Service.

By using the Service the Customer agrees to these General Terms and the
Supplier’s standard [Data Processing
Agreement](https://d2qulvgqu65efe.cloudfront.net/Whereby_Data_Processing_Agreement_Standard_Contract_Clauses_-_for_web.pdf),
hereunder the [Privacy Policy](/information/tos/privacy-policy/), for
Whereby (collectively referred to as “Terms”). The Terms shall form an
integral part of the Whereby Services Order Form issued by the Customer
describing the use and the providing of the Service (“Order Form”). 

## 2. The Service (Whereby)

The Service provided to the Customer by the Supplier is a developer API
as an extension of the Business plan for the Customer to integrate
Whereby in their own products or tools.

Whereby Embedded creates one-time meeting rooms that are deleted
after the meeting is over. These meetings can be embedded in the
Customers app. 

The use of Whereby requires that the user has hardware, software and an
Internet connection fulfilling certain recommended requirements, as may
be specified in [our Support Center](https://whereby.helpscoutdocs.com). If
the recommended requirements are not met, the user may potentially still
use the Service, but normally with lower quality or performance. Such
reduced quality or performance will not give the Customer the right to
claim any compensation from the Supplier.

The Customer is responsible for the use of Whereby when Whereby is used
as described above, including the lawfulness of any content displayed,
shared, uploaded or otherwise made available by the Customer in the
Service (“User Content”). 

## 3. Content and Use of the Service

risk. The Supplier does not endorse, support, represent or guarantee the
completeness, truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any Content or
communications posted via the Service or endorse any opinions expressed
via the Service. 

The Customer understands that by using the Service, the Customer may be
exposed to Content which is not within the control of the Supplier and
that might be offensive, harmful, inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate,
or in some cases, Content that has been mislabeled or is otherwise
deceptive. Under no circumstances will the Supplier be liable in any way
for any Content, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions
in any Content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result
of the use of any Content generated or made available via the Service.

The Supplier gives the Customer a limited, worldwide, royalty-free
(other than included in the fee for the Service), non-assignable,
non-sublicensable and non-exclusive license to use the software and any
other intellectual property rights that are provided to the Customer by
the Supplier as part of the Service for the Customer’s business use.
This license is for the sole purpose of enabling the Customer to use the
Service as provided by the Supplier, subject to these Terms.

The Customer or any user may not do any of the following while accessing
or using the Service:

such could be restricted under applicable export control laws. The
Customer shall not export or re-export the Service or parts of it in
violation of such laws or regulations.

The Supplier does not provide an archiving service, and you are solely
responsible for creating backups of User Content.

## 4. Fees and payment

Any fee for the use of the Service is included in the Order Form which
includes the limits for usage of the Service. The Customer has 12 months
from Service Start Date (as defined in the Order Form) to use the
Service.

By using the Service, the Customer must enter into the Business plan for
Whereby. 

Details around use and billing of Whereby Embedded will be outlined in
the Order Form the Customer commits to. The Supplier will notify all
paying users of material changes to the content, price and terms of the
plan.

Usage per year is calculated using the metric Participants in Meetings
(PIM). PIM is calculated by the Supplier to measure usage. E.g: if there
is one meeting with 2 participants, that will calculate 2 PIM. If there
is one meeting with 4 people, that calculates as 4 PIM. The length of a
meeting does not affect PIM or cost.

All payments shall be made in advance or otherwise set forth in the
Order Form. A number of PIM is included in the term of the Service as
specified in the Order Form. If the Customer has used all PIM prior to
the end of the term, the Customer must purchase additional PIM to
continue using the Service the remaining period of the term. Should the
Customer purchase additional PIM, the Supplier can require any
outstanding balance to be paid.  Upon renewal of the term, additional
PIM is included in the new term.  

In the case payment is not received by the Supplier, the Customer will
be notified by email and as part of the service. The Supplier may
suspend the Service by disabling or blocking access to the Service until
payment of all invoices is settled and correct payment (inclusive any
interests on delayed payment) has been received. 

The Supplier reserves the right to make amendments to the fee for the
Service upon any renewal of the Service by the Customer. The Customer
shall be informed on any amendments to the fee prior to accepting the
renewal. 

If the Service is cancelled by the Customer, the Customer will have
access to the Service for the remainder of the period the Customer has
paid for. 

If payment is made by credit card, the payment process, including the
processing and storing of credit card data, will be provided by a
subcontractor of the Supplier as a payment provider and will be subject
to the terms of the payment provider which are included in the payment
process. By agreeing to these terms and continuing to operate as a
customer of the Supplier, the Customer agrees to be bound by the payment
provider’s terms, as the same may be modified by the payment provider
from time to time. As a condition of using the payment process, the
Customer agrees to provide the Supplier and/or the payment provider
accurate and complete information about the Customer and the Customer’s
business, and the Customer authorizes the Supplier to share with the
payment provider this information, including any transaction
information, related to the Customer’s use of the payment processing
services provided by the payment provider.

All fees are stated exclusive of any applicable taxes, and the Customer
is required to pay any sales, use, GST, value-added, withholding, or
similar taxes or duties, whether domestic or foreign, related to the
transactions under this Agreement, other than taxes based on the income
of the Supplier. The Customer will pay all amounts due under this Terms
and the Order Form in full without any set-off, counterclaim, deduction
or withholding. In the event any payment that the Customer makes under
this Agreement is subject to a deduction or withholding, the Customer
shall be responsible for making the appropriate payment to the
appropriate taxing authorities and financially responsible for interest,
penalties, fines, or similar liabilities resulting from the Customer’s
failure to timely remit such taxes to the proper governmental authority
or agency. The Customer shall provide applicable tax
receipts/certificates of such withholding to the Supplier on a timely
basis.

## 5. Privacy and Personal Data 

When delivering the Service, the Supplier will collect and process
personal data about the Customer and the Customer’s and any user’s use
of the Service. The Customer will be the data controller and the
Supplier the data processor with regard to the processing of personal
data. All processing of personal data by the Supplier will be subject to
the Supplier’s standard [Data Processing
Agreement](https://d2qulvgqu65efe.cloudfront.net/Whereby_Data_Processing_Agreement_Standard_Contract_Clauses_-_for_web.pdf). 

The processing of personal data is in addition subject to the Supplier’s
Privacy Policy available on [this
page](https://whereby.com/information/tos/privacy-policy/).

## 6. Confidentiality

Each party (as “Receiving Party”) agrees that all business, technical
and financial information it obtains from the disclosing party
(“Disclosing Party”) constitutes the confidential property of the
Disclosing Party (“Confidential Information”), provided that it is
identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be
reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be confidential or
proprietary due to the nature of the information disclosed and the
circumstances surrounding the disclosure. The Terms and Order Form are
deemed the Supplier’s Confidential Information.  Except as expressly
authorized herein, the Receiving Party will (1) hold in confidence and
not disclose any Confidential Information to third parties and (2) not
use Confidential Information for any purpose other than fulfilling its
obligations and exercising its rights under the Terms. The Receiving
Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents,
contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know,
provided that such representatives are bound to confidentiality
obligations no less protective of the Disclosing Party than this Section
6 and that the Receiving Party remains responsible for compliance by any
such representative with the terms of this Section 6. 

The Receiving Party’s confidentiality obligations will not apply to
information that the Receiving Party can document: (a) was rightfully in
its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential
Information; (b) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of
the Receiving Party; (c) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party
from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation, or
(d) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who
had no access to such information. The Receiving Party may make
disclosures to the extent required by Laws or court order, provided that
(unless prohibited by Laws) the Receiving Party notifies the Disclosing
Party in advance and cooperates in any effort to obtain confidential
treatment.

## 7. Communication and Support

The customer will provide tier one support for their end users on the
platform. The supplier will provide white label training material and
guidance for support of video meetings to the customer. If further
escalation is required to assist the end user, the supplier will provide
support to the customer's service team rather than the end user. Any support
of the end user directly will need to be in writing and include agreed upon
terms by the Customer and Supplier. 

## 8. Marketing and Attribution

Supplier can use Customer’s logo, trademarks, and trade names in its
marketing materials including website, email, social media, and press
releases. Supplier may use quotes provided by Customer in marketing
materials including website, email, social media, and press releases.
Customer will participate in a promotable case study, which will require
minimal time from Customer.

Customer will include attribution to their use of the Whereby platform
that is visible to customers while in a video meeting. This should
include, but doesn’t have to be limited to, the Whereby logo being
visible during the entire meeting. 

## 9. Intellectual Property Rights

as in any other countries.

transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and worldwide license to use,
reproduce, store, modify, distribute, publish and create derivative
works of such User Content for the purpose of providing the Service to
the Customer. The Customer represents and warrants that the Customer
owns any User Content submitted by the Customer or that the Customer
otherwise is entitled to submit such User Content and to grant the
Supplier such license.

## 10. Term and termination

The term for providing the Service is included in the Order Form (the
“Initial Term”). Upon the expiry of the Initial Term, the term is
automatically prolonged for an additional period (the “Renewal Term”) if
the Service is not terminated within one month prior to the expiry of
the Initial Term. Upon the expiry of any Renewal Term, the Service will
be automatically prolonged for a new Renewal Term if the Service is not
terminated within one month prior to the expiry of the Renewal Term. 

If the Customer terminates the Service, the Customer will have access to
the Service for the remaining (pre-paid) period. The Supplier reserves
the right to terminate the Service and the agreement with the Customer
with immediate effect upon written notice to the Customer in case of a
material breach of the Terms or violation of the restriction on Content
or the use of the Service. The Customer is not entitled to refunds upon
termination due to breach on the part of the Customer. 

The Supplier reserves the right to suspend or terminate the Service in
whole or part at any time, with or without cause, and with or without
notice, without incurring liability of any kind. For example, the
Supplier may suspend or terminate the Customer’s use if the Customer or
users are not complying with the Terms, or if the Customer or the users
use the Service in any way that may cause us legal liability or disrupt
others’ use of the Service or damage to the Supplier’s business or
reputation, or for any other reason.
