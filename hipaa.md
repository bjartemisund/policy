# Whereby and HIPAA compliance

## What is HIPAA? 

HIPAA stands for Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 which is a US federal law that requires the adoption of national standards for appropriate and secure handling of electronic health data. In other words, healthcare providers in the US must conform to the HIPAA standards that ensure that they process protected health data in a responsible, private and secure maner. The law is under the oversight of the Department of Health and Human services, Office of the National Coordinator for Health and the National Institute of Standards and Technology which are also responsible for enforcing the HIPAA rules. 

## Whereby Embedded and HIPAA

One key industry and geographic location for Whereby is the healthcare industry in the US. As Whereby can seamlessly integrate with online applications, various telehealth providers use Whereby to provide meaningful video connections. 

According to HIPAA, entities which perform activities that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information (PHI) for a covered entity or that provide service to a covered entity is considered a business associate. It also requires A Business Associate Agreement (BAA),a written agreement that specifies each party's responsibilities when it comes to PHI, being concluded between the business associate and covered entity. 

Though Whereby provides video conferencing services to healthcare companies, Whereby will never have access to protected health information given its end-to-end encryption capabilities. Even if protected health information would be disclosed over a call, it remains private, as nobody, not even Whereby can access it. Read more on how to use the HIPAA compliant setup for Whereby Embedded [here](https://docs.whereby.com/hipaa-compliant-setup). 

Therefore Whereby will be indirectly linked with healthcare providers, being a supplier of software for them and suppliers that do not have access to protected health data. We enter into BAA as Business Associates which is a part of HIPAA compliant package and is available, on demand, as part of our yearly pricing plan.

## How is Whereby Embedded a HIPAA compliant service? 

Whereby understands there are many use cases that customers would choose to use Whereby Embedded. These use cases may involve, for example, sharing of patient names with Whereby, or sharing of certain personal or health identifiers via the integration in the web application to further improve the video experience. 

To facilitate a good collaboration and to assure our customers that they will remain HIPAA compliant while using Whereby Embedded, we have prepared the following:
1. A Business Associate Agreement that is ready to sign by our customers, ensuring there is legal assurance in place, as required by HIPAA
2. A HIPAA compliant package for Whereby Embedded that can be activated on-demand for our Embedded customers that are using the yearly plan

The HIPAA compliant package is a collection of customer account settings and infrastructure aspects that provide the necessary assurance. To find out more, reach out to your Whereby contact.

## Is Whereby HIPAA certified?

The US governmental agencies that oversee health technology standards do not certify software and off-the-shelf products nor do they accredit independent agencies or private companies to certify other entities as HIPAA compliant. In other words, it is not possible for a SaaS offering like Whereby Embedded to get certified for HIPAA. 

Despite the above, Whereby takes appropriate security, privacy and organizational measures to ensure data, be it personal or health, is adequately handled and protected as per applicable laws .

Whereby is audited on a yearly basis by ISO accredited auditors for maintenance of our ISO27001 certification and many controls in the ISO27002 standard are equivalent with those in the Security rule of HIPAA. 

We want to support our customers in their HIPAA compliance efforts in the best way we can. We cannot provide legal advice for our customers on HIPAA compliance and customers are ultimately responsible for determining the applicability of, and shall comply with as applicable, all legislative and regulatory requirements of privacy, security and electronic transaction components of HIPAA.  For whatever happens outside of the scope of Whereby Embedded, our customers are directly responsible. Whereby is only responsible for providing the customer sufficient information to determine if the customer can use Whereby in a compliant manner and assist to configure their use of Whereby to achieve conformance with HIPAA.
